在朋友圈晒晒度假照片也许让你感觉良好，但是在满足自己虚荣心的同时，最好不要发一些招人烦的照片，比如自拍、热狗腿、亲吻……否则在你浑然不觉的时候，别人对你的好感度已经大大降低。嘿，往哪看?说你呢!

`Selfies and hot dog legs have been revealed as being among the most annoying Instagram travel poses around.`

调查显示，自拍和热狗腿是最招人烦的Ins旅游拍照姿势。

注：“热狗腿”就是晒出两条热狗般的纤瘦有型的油亮双腿。

Shots of loved-up couples kissing have also been deemed irritating by the social media community, as has the candid 'looking away' shot.

在社交媒体的网友眼中，热恋情侣亲吻的照片和看向别处的抓拍照片也让人不爽。

Other poses to get the thumbs down include people 'pinching' the sunset, freeze jumping and walking away from the camera.

其他招来恶评的摆拍姿势包括人们“捏住”夕阳、定格跳跃瞬间和从镜头前走开。

The research, conducted by UK cruise agent Bolsover Cruise Club, set out to find the most annoying holiday Instagram poses filling our social media feeds.

英国邮轮代理商博尔索弗邮轮俱乐部开展的这项研究旨在找出社交媒体动态上最让人厌恶的Ins度假拍照姿势。

More than a third of the public said they weren’t a fan of selfies, just ahead of beach snaps of 'hot dog legs'.

超三分之一的公众表示他们不喜欢看自拍，其次是沙滩“热狗腿”照片。

The poses were disliked by the public because they felt that they were overly pretentious, and a bit too show off, while also ruining the often-picturesque landscapes and backdrops of the holiday destinations they were taken at.

公众不喜欢这些姿势是因为他们觉得这些姿势太做作，而且太爱炫耀，与此同时还破坏了度假地风景如画的山水背景。

The research revealed that Instagrammers were tempted to hit the 'unfollow' button when more than 12 holiday pictures cropped up on their feed.

调查揭示，当动态页面上出现12张以上的度假照片时，Ins用户会很想对此人取关。

It also found that there is a strong divide in opinions between age and gender groups on what makes a good vacation snap.

调查还发现，对于什么是好的度假照片，不同年龄和性别的人群意见分歧很大。

A quarter of women said they were annoyed by followees posting their ‘hot dog legs’, while men were 20 percent less likely to be irritated by the same pose.

四分之一的女性表示，她们不喜欢自己关注的人上传 “热狗腿”照片，而有此同感的男性比女性少了20%。

And research showed the under-24s are five times (46 percent) more likely to be annoyed than 45-54s (nine percent) when seeing pictures of kissing couples.

调查还显示，看到情侣亲吻照片时，24岁以下的人比45-54岁的人更容易感到厌恶，前者有46%的人不喜欢看这种照片，后者只有9%，前者是后者的5倍。

It seems jealousy is also rife across this age group with under-24s four times more likely to be annoyed by holiday photos than older people.

嫉妒心理似乎在24岁以下人群中普遍存在，被度假照片惹恼的年轻人比年长的人多四倍。

Interestingly, men proved keener than women to show off romantic displays of affection, voting the ‘kissing partners’ pose as their second favourite compared to nearly a fifth of women voting it as their most annoying.

有趣的是，事实证明男性比女性更爱展示感情外露的浪漫照片，投票结果显示，男性认为“亲吻伴侣”是自己第二喜欢的拍照姿势，相比之下，近五分之一的女性表示这是她们最烦的拍照姿势。

那么，哪些照片类型不会招人烦，反而能收获颇多点赞呢?

Snappers should think more about taking shots of wonderful landmarks they encounter on holiday, with followers most likely to hit the precious ‘like’ button when seeing sites such as Iceland’s famous Blue Lagoon, the world’s tallest building, Dubai’s Burj Khalifa, and the Duomo di Milano cathedral in Milan.

拍照者应考虑多拍一些度假时见到的壮观地标，这种类型的照片是关注者最可能点赞的，比如冰岛著名的蓝泻湖、世界最高建筑迪拜哈利法塔和米兰大教堂。

Commenting on the results, a spokesperson from Bolsover Cruise Club said: 'It was quite surprising to see how many males favoured the more romantic poses on holiday with females identifying the "kissing partner" pose as more irritating.

博尔索弗邮轮俱乐部的发言人针对调查结果评论说：“看见这么多男性喜欢假日浪漫亲吻照片，而女性却讨厌这种照片，还是挺让人惊讶的。”

'With the social media craze all around and Instagram users continually on the rise, it begs the question of what poses will dominate Instagram in the following years or whether the popular poses in this research are here to stay.'

“当前社交媒体盛行，[Ins](https://www.instagram.com)用户持续增加，这让人不禁发问：什么样的拍照姿势会在未来主导Ins，调查中出现的流行姿势是否还会继续受欢迎。”
